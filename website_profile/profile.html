            <h2> Extraculliar activities </h2>
            <p> I was already quite passionate about gaming before I took a gap year. Games like Call of Duty,
                Rainbow
                Six Siege, and Escape from Tarkov provided me with a sense of challenge, strategy that I treasured.

                started working as a server at Oud Hulst, which I truly loved.It gave me excellent customer service
                experience and helped me establish completely new connections with people.
                The decision I made to accept a comparable position at Dok 14 was motivated by my desire for new
                opportunities.
                My passion of gaming and my exploration of various waiter professions during my gap year led to a
                remarkable
                time.
                It gave me a moment to reflect, helped me identify my passions and goals, and eventually prepared me for
                the
                next chapter in my life.
