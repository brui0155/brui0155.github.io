                <h3> Who am I?</h3>
                <p>Hi I am Lars. I am 19 years old. I turn 20 this year on the 1st of December which is kind of crazy
                    because I don't feel that old yet and then my teens are over. I had a rather confusing school life
                    before I got here. I started in Terneuzen at het Zeldenrust college, where I started with VWO
                    billingiyual teaching. After two years I went to HAVO but still bilingual teaching. In my fourth
                    year I failed the year and transferred to het Reyneart College in Hulst. Here I graduated and went
                    on to go into a gap year. I was already working as A waiter then but because my ex worked at the
                    same place and the salary wasn't too good I switched workplaces to go work with my best friend Joep.
                    In this gap year I went looking for a study and that is how I ended up here at HZ.
                </p>

                <H3>Where am I from?</H3>
                <p>I was born in Terneuzen and I have lived most of my life here. My parents got divorced when I was
                    twelve and after a couple of years after the divorce my mom went to live with her new husband in
                    Hulst. I now have two houses to live at and share these with my brother, sister and in Hulst I even
                    have a stepbrother, stepsister and halfbrother who is only 4 years old.
                </p>

                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>My hobbies mostly consist of gaming. As you could see at the home page I play a variety of games and
                    this has been my passion since I bought my own Playstation 4. I used to do Judo for about 10 years
                    but the sport got repetitive so I quitted around COVID. Since then I haven't played a sport
                    consitenly but now airsoft has peaked my interest so I might do that more often. I also like fishing
                    with my brother and father.
                </p>
