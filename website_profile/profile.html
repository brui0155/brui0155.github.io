        <h2> Extraculliar activities </h2>
        <p> <br>I was already quite passionate about gaming before I took a gap year. Games like Call of Duty,
            Rainbow
            Six Siege, and Escape from Tarkov provided me with a sense of challenge, strategy that I treasured.
            </br>
            <br> started working as a server at Oud Hulst, which I truly loved.It gave me excellent customer service
            experience and helped me establish completely new connections with people.
            The decision I made to accept a comparable position at Dok 14 was motivated by my desire for new
            opportunities.</br>
            <br> My passion of gaming and my exploration of various waiter professions during my gap year led to a
            remarkable
            time.
            It gave me a moment to reflect, helped me identify my passions and goals, and eventually prepared me for
            the
            next chapter in my life.</br>
