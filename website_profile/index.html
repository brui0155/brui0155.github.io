                    <h1>My reason why I chose HBO ICT</h1>
                    <p> In my gap year I did not know what I wanted to study but I needed to start next year or
                        otherwise I
                        would be stuck working as a waiter for the rest of my life. Not that being a waiter is a bad job
                        but
                        I
                        could not see myself as a waiter my whole life. So as any person would do that has no idea what
                        he
                        wants
                        to do for the rest of his or her life I set out to look at studies and what I wanted to do
                        whilst I
                        had
                        my gap year. I got the tip to look into ICT so
                        with this newly collected information I set out and looked what my options were. Keep in mind
                        that I
                        hadnt even considered going
                        to this study because in high school I have always thought that I would become a teacher in
                        history
                        or
                        hotel management. So then I found out there is a ICT study near where I live at a place called
                        Middelburg. I went to the open days and I immediatley loved the place, people and how the study
                        works. I
                        applied and now here I am.</p>

                <h2>My previous experience with coding</h2>
                <p>My previous experience of coding or almost anything related to ICT is basically non existing however
                    I
                    have always liked playing games or use the internet. I have talked earlier to my parents or my
                    stepfather that working in the development of games would be something I would love to do but I
                    never
                    went further then just thinking about it. Over the years of playing videogames my love for them has
                    only
                    grown more and more. I even bought a gaming laptop just to play more games. So as you can read I do
                    not
                    have much experience but I have always thought about programming and I would love to get to know how
                    this crazy yet stunning world works.</p>
